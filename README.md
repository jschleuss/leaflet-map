Making a map (and other things)

Creating a leaflet map is actually pretty easy and even if you don't know how to code you can put together the data.

Go say hi to the lovely people at http://leafletjs.com/

1. Get a blank HTML template. Don't know how to do that? Google.

<html>
	<head>
		<title>Your first map</title>
	</head>
	<body>
		<div id="map"></div>
	</body>
</html>
